### 🚀 About Me
I've been designing, developing and delivering Desktop, Web, Mobile, SaaS (various domains), Cloud solutions through all the noise. 
Today, my mission is to lead, design, develop, deliver **AI-Native, Agent-First Solutions** that blend human ingenuity with intelligent automation.

I specialize in **Agent Native Architecture** — building systems where AI agents are first-class citizens in the application architecture, not just feature add-ons.

### 🛠 Current Projects

#### **[FieldNative](https://fieldnative.app)** — Agent Native Field Service Platform
A next-generation field service management platform built from the ground up with **Agent Native Architecture**.

**🤖 Agent Native Implementation:**
- **Autonomous Scheduling Agent**: Uses constraint-based reasoning to optimize technician routes and appointment scheduling in real-time
- **Dynamic Pricing Agent**: Analyzes market conditions, historical data, and competitive intelligence to recommend optimal pricing
- **Customer Intelligence Agent**: Maintains rich contextual understanding of customer preferences, communication history, and service patterns
- **Knowledge Base Agent**: Continuously learns from service tickets, technician notes, and outcomes to improve troubleshooting recommendations
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination system where agents communicate, negotiate, and collaborate to solve complex business problems

**🏗️ Architecture Highlights:**
- **Agent Communication Protocol**: Custom inter-agent messaging system using event-driven architecture
- **Context Management**: Persistent agent memory with vector embeddings for semantic retrieval
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Strategic intervention points where agents escalate decisions requiring human judgment
- **Observability**: Real-time agent decision tracking, audit trails, and performance metrics
- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents continuously improve through feedback loops and outcome analysis

**🔧 Tech Stack:**
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI with async agent orchestration
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, custom embeddings with pgvector
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase for real-time subscriptions
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph for multi-agent workflows, custom agent abstractions
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend), Redis for agent state management

### 📚 Actively Learning & Implementing

#### **Agent Native Architecture Principles:**
- **Agents as First-Class Citizens**: Designing systems where AI agents are core architectural components, not bolt-on features
- **Context Engineering**: Building rich, persistent context frameworks that enable agents to maintain state and learn over time
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Implementing coordination patterns where multiple specialized agents collaborate to solve complex problems
- **Agent Observability**: Creating comprehensive monitoring, logging, and debugging tools for agent behavior and decision-making

#### **Current Focus Areas:**
- **LangGraph & LangChain**: Advanced agent workflows and state management
- **Vector Databases**: Semantic search and retrieval with pgvector and Pinecone
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective system prompts and agent instructions for consistent, reliable behavior
- **Agent Testing**: Developing evaluation frameworks for agent performance and reliability
- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Implementing hybrid automation with seamless human expert review for quality and compliance
- **Data Infrastructure & Intelligence**: Intelligent foundations for data discovery, cleansing, and contextual modeling
