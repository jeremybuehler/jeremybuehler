### 🚀 About Me
I've been designing, developing and delivering Desktop, Web, Mobile, SaaS (various domains), Cloud solutions through all the noise.
Today, my mission is to lead, design, develop, deliver **AI-Native, Agent-First Solutions** that blend human ingenuity with intelligent automation.

I specialize in **Agent Native Architecture** — building systems where AI agents are first-class citizens in the application architecture, not just feature add-ons.

### 📚 Actively Learning & Implementing

#### **Agent Native Architecture Principles:**
- **Agents as First-Class Citizens**: Designing systems where AI agents are core architectural components, not bolt-on features
- **Context Engineering**: Building rich, persistent context frameworks that enable agents to maintain state and learn over time
- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Strategic intervention points where agents propose actions requiring human judgment
- **Agent Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and debugging tools for agent behavior and decision-making

#### **Current Focus Areas:**
- **LangGraph & LangChain**: Advanced agent workflows and state management
- **Vector Databases**: Semantic search and retrieval with pgvector and Pinecone
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective system prompts and agent instructions for consistent, reliable behavior
- **Agent Testing**: Developing evaluation frameworks for agent performance and reliability
- **Multi-Provider AI Resilience**: Automatic failover between AI providers for production reliability
- **Data Infrastructure & Intelligence**: Intelligent foundations for data discovery, cleansing, and contextual modeling
