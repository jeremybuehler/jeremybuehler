# 👋 Hey, I’m Jeremy

**AI Generalist | Engineer | Entrepreneur | Veteran | Builder of AI-Native Platforms**

### 🚀 About Me
I’ve been coding and building solutions since 1999 — from SaaS to mobile to web.  
Today, my mission is to create **NextGen AI-Native, AI-First platforms** that blend human ingenuity with intelligent automation.

I’m obsessed with:
- 🤖 **Applied AI & Agents** — true autonomous systems, not just LLM wrappers  
- 🧠 **Context Engineering** — crafting intelligent systems that deeply understand their users  
- ⚙️ **Workflow Orchestration** — connecting AI, agents, and humans into high-impact loops  
- 🌍 **Resilient Systems** — scalable, fault-tolerant, future-proof architectures

---

### 🛠 Current Projects
- **[ClaimCompass](https://claimcompass.ai)** — AI-Native public adjuster platform for property damage claims  
- **BuehlerCoreAgent** — Hybrid TS/Python agent mesh + orchestration framework  
- **MyHealth Project** — Personal health stack + intelligent tracking for long-term wellness  
- **Personal Human Context Framework** — AI-consumable “operating manual” for human-AI interaction

---

### 📚 What I’m Learning
- Python for AI agent orchestration  
- FastAPI backend design  
- Model Context Protocols (MCPs)  
- Multi-agent architectures & agent mesh systems

---

### 📈 Vision
Build **AI that works *with* humans, not instead of them** — integrating *Human-In-The-Loop* into every intelligent system.  
My goal: deliver **10x better outcomes** by combining automation, oversight, and continuous learning loops.
